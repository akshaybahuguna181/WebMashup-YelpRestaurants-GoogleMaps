# WebMashup-YelpRestaurants-GoogleMaps
 The goal of this project is to create a web mashup that combines two web services: Google Maps and the Yelp API for Developers, using JavaScript and AJAX
 
 # Description of application:
 After we center the Google Map to a geographical area and enter some terms, such as "Indian Restaurant", the application will find the best matches (eg, the best Indian restaurants) inside the map area, it will mark their location on the map, and will display some information about these restaurants on the web page.

# Used the following resources:
1. Yelp Fusion API
2. Google Maps Developer API version 3.0
3. Google Map markers to plot restaurants/business on map frame


# Instructions to run:
1. Place all three files together in a folder inside directory of XAMPP server htdocs folder.
2. Start the server and browse the yelp.html file to start the application.
